\usage{
eem_coble_peaks2(eem, abs_data, noise_ratio = 5, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eem}{an object of class eem or eemlist}

\item{abs_data}{dataframe of absorbance data matching the samples, used to calculate relative fluorescence efficiency}

\item{noise_ratio}{numeric indicating the noise threshold for ratio calculations}

\item{verbose}{logical determining if additional messages should be printed}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame containing fluorescence peaks and indices for each sample
}
\description{
Modified from 'eem_coble_peaks' from eemR package to include some additional indices and
modified definitions of Coble peaks.  For indices that are ratios, the values in the ratio
must be 5 times (or specifed amount) greater than the area below the 1:1 line (considered noise). If the
desired wavelength is not explicitly measured the EEM will be interpolated using
the interp2 function from the pracma library.

\details{
Coble peaks are based on Coble et al. 2014 and are defined as follows:

Peak B (pB): ex = 270:280 nm, em = 300:320 nm, Tyrosine-like

Peak T (pT): ex = 270:280 nm, em = 320:350 nm, Tryptophan-like

Peak A (pA): ex = 250:260 nm, em = 380:480 nm, Humic-like.

Peak M (pM): ex = 310:320 nm, em = 380:420 nm, Marine humic-like

Peak C (pC): ex = 330:350 nm, em = 420:480 nm, Humic-like

Peak D (pD): ex = 390 nm, em = 509 nm, Soil fulvic acid

Peak E (pE): ex = 455 nm, em = 521 nm, Soil fulvic acid

Peak N (pN): ex = 280 nm, em = 370 nm, Plankton derived

Given that peaks A, B, C, M, and T are not defined at fixed excitation and emission wavelength, the maximum fluorescence value in the region is extracted.


Additional fluorescence indices are based on Hansen et al. 2016.
Measurements are defined as follows:

rAT: The ratio of peak A to peak T, indication of the amount of humic like (recalcitrant) to fresh (liable) DOM.

rCA: The ratio of peak C to peak A, indication of the amount of humic like to fumic like DOM.

rCM: The ratio of peak C to peak M, indication of the amount of diagenetically altered (blueshifted) DOM.

rCT: The ratio of peak C to peak T, indication of the amount of humic like (recalcitrant) to fresh (liable) DOM.

Fluorescence Index (FI): Ratio of fluorescence at ex = 370 nm, em = 470 nm to em = 520 nm.
Identifies the relative contributions of terrestrial to microbial DOM sources.

Humification Index (HIX): ex = 254 nm, em =\eqn{\sum}435:480 divided by em =\eqn{\sum}435:480, \eqn{\sum}300:345.
An indication of humic substances or extent of humification. Higher values indicate an higher degree of humification.

Freshness Index (\eqn{\beta:\alpha}, fresh): ex = 310 nm, ratio of em = 380 nm to max in em = 420:435 nm.
An indication of recently produced DOM, higher values indicate more recently produced DOM.

Relative Fluorescence Efficiency (RFE): Ratio of fluorescence at ex = 370 nm, em = 460 nm to
absorbance at 370 nm. An indicator of the relative amount of algal to non-algal DOM.

Biological Index (BIX): ex = 310 nm, ratio of em = 380 nm to em = 430 nm.
An indicator of autotrophic productivity, values above 1 indicate recently produced
autochthonous DOM.
