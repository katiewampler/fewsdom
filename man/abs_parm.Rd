\title{Get absorbance peaks and indices}
\usage{
abs_parm(abs_data, waves = NULL, meta, keep_all = F, cuvle = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{abs_data}{a dataframe containing the absorbance data, where each column is a sample}

\item{waves}{optional, a vector of wavelengths in nm to extract from the absorbance data}

\item{meta}{the metadata table for the sample run, should include DOC data in mg/L}

\item{keep_all}{a logical, TRUE will return all samples even those without DOC data, FALSE will only return samples with DOC data}

\item{cuvle}{the length of the cuvette in cm}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of indices.
}
\description{
Takes a dataframe of absorbance data and calculates optical properties for
each sample. If data was collected at greater than 1 nm intervals, data will
be interpolated to 1 nm intervals.
}
\details{
Absorbance indices based on Hansen et al. 2016. Measurements are defined as follows:

SUVA254, SUVA280, SUVA350, SUVA370: SUVA at 254, 280, 350, and 370 nm.
Units of \eqn{\text{L mgC}^{-1} \text{m}^{-1}}.
Typically higher values are associated with greater aromatic content.

SVA412, SVA440, SVA480, SVA510,
SVA532, SVA555: SVA at 412, 440, 480, 510, 532, 555 nm.
Units of \eqn{\text{L mgC}^{-1} \text{m}^{-1}}.
Typically higher values are associated with greater aromatic content.

S275_295: Spectral slope between 275 to 295 nm.

S350_400: Spectral slope between 350 to 400 nm.

Spectral slopes are found with a nonlinear fit of an exponential function to
the absorption spectrum, typically higher  values are associated with
lower molecular weight materials and/or lower aromaticity.

SR: Spectral slope S275_295 divided by spectral slope S350_400, negatively correlated to DOM molecular weight
and generally increases on irradiation.
